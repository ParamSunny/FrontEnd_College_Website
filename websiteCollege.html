                <h1>Story Line</h1>
                <br>
            <p> <h2>A</h2>s 1st year students from the branch of AI and ML, we were    
faced with a problem and desire to do something for the college and develop our    abilities, and here we are with a web page designed by Paramveer Singh.
<br><br>
After being inspired by the teachers to do something, I came up with the idea but we had no idea who to tell. As me overcame the first semester, our section changed and now me and my friends is in completely different section and our idea/planes was mostly forgotten.
<br><br>
It was the Python lab, and the teacher was on leave. It was arranged in such a way that the teacher encouraged us to do some projects that would enhance our learning, and from the 1st year only, he encouraged us to work on the skills by doing projects. Based on what he inspired, what happened in the past is only what happened in the past. He said that if you have a good idea for something we can accomplish, just come to me and I will do everything I can to make your idea a reality. The lines that we desired to hear, I discussed to do work on my first project and he provided me with great advice. He was the person we wanted to speak to, and we had a casual conversation with him and he offered us some great suggestions.
<br><br>
After leaving college event, I work on the project route. Here I make with what I know and try my best. If you don't like it, then please tell me so I can learn more and improve my work. Iam working to bring you the best experience possible; I know it's not perfect, but I doing my best :).</p>
